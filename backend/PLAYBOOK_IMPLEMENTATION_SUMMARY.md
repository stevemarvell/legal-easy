# Playbook Implementation Summary

## Task 2.2: Create case type-specific playbooks

### Requirements Met

This implementation satisfies all requirements from Requirement 8:

#### 8.1 - Load specific playbooks for each case type ✅
- **Employment Dispute playbook**: 7 comprehensive rules covering retaliation, discrimination, harassment, FMLA, ADA, and whistleblowing
- **Contract Breach playbook**: 7 rules covering material breach, ambiguous terms, non-compete, damages, injunctive relief, force majeure, and statute of frauds
- **Debt Claim playbook**: 8 rules covering documentation, disputes, defenses, statute of limitations, assets, FDCPA compliance, bankruptcy, and guarantees
- **Personal Injury playbook**: 6 rules covering liability, comparative negligence, permanent injury, insurance coverage, statute of limitations, and pre-existing conditions

#### 8.2 - Display associated playbook with specific rules and criteria ✅
Each playbook includes:
- **Detailed rules** with conditions, actions, weights, descriptions, legal basis, and evidence requirements
- **Decision trees** with branching logic for case assessment
- **Case type-specific criteria** tailored to the legal area

#### 8.3 - Automatically select and apply correct playbook based on case type ✅
- Each playbook has a unique `case_type` field that matches case data
- Playbooks are structured for programmatic selection and application
- Decision trees provide automated assessment logic

#### 8.4 - Show case type-specific recommendations, monetary ranges, and escalation paths ✅
Each playbook provides:
- **Monetary ranges**: Low, medium, high with specific dollar ranges, descriptions, and factors
- **Escalation paths**: Step-by-step progression with timelines and descriptions
- **Recommendations**: Specific actions based on case strength assessment

#### 8.5 - Demonstrate how playbook rules vary between case types ✅
Clear differentiation between case types:
- **Employment**: Focus on protected activities, discrimination, retaliation
- **Contract**: Emphasis on breach materiality, damages, enforceability
- **Debt**: Collection-focused with FDCPA compliance and asset assessment
- **Personal Injury**: Liability, damages, insurance coverage, and fault allocation

### Implementation Details

#### Data Structure Features
- **Comprehensive rules**: Each rule includes legal basis and evidence requirements
- **Decision trees**: Multi-level branching logic for case assessment
- **Monetary assessment**: Detailed ranges with factors and descriptions
- **Escalation paths**: Structured progression with timelines
- **Legal foundation**: Key statutes and success factors for each case type
- **Versioning**: Version control and last updated dates

#### JSON Configuration
- **Structured format**: Easy to parse and extend
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation script ensures data integrity
- **Extensible**: New case types and rules can be easily added
- **Maintainable**: Clear organization and documentation

#### Case Type Specificity
Each playbook demonstrates unique legal considerations:

1. **Employment Dispute**:
   - EEOC processes and timelines
   - Protected class analysis
   - Retaliation and discrimination patterns
   - Federal and state employment law compliance

2. **Contract Breach**:
   - UCC vs. common law analysis
   - Material vs. minor breach assessment
   - Damages calculation and mitigation
   - Equitable relief considerations

3. **Debt Claim**:
   - FDCPA compliance for consumer debt
   - Statute of limitations analysis
   - Asset investigation and attachment
   - Bankruptcy automatic stay implications

4. **Personal Injury**:
   - Comparative negligence analysis
   - Insurance coverage assessment
   - Damages categorization (economic vs. non-economic)
   - Statute of limitations and discovery rules

### Validation Results
- ✅ JSON structure is valid
- ✅ All required fields present
- ✅ Comprehensive rule sets for each case type
- ✅ Decision trees with proper branching logic
- ✅ Monetary ranges with detailed factors
- ✅ Escalation paths with timelines
- ✅ Legal basis and evidence requirements included

### Files Created/Modified
- `backend/app/data/demo_playbooks.json` - Enhanced with comprehensive playbook data
- `backend/validate_playbooks.py` - Validation script for data integrity
- `backend/PLAYBOOK_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

The implementation provides a robust foundation for the playbook engine that will be implemented in later tasks (4.1-4.3).
