INTERNAL SAFETY REPORT
TechCorp Solutions Ltd.

Report Date: 10 December 2023
Reported By: Sarah Chen, Senior Safety Engineer
Employee ID: TC-2022-0847
Department: Environmental Health & Safety

INCIDENT/HAZARD DESCRIPTION:
During routine facility inspection on 8 December 2023, I identified critical safety violations in the chemical storage area (Building C, Room 105). The ventilation system is inadequate for the types and quantities of chemicals being stored, creating serious health risks for employees.

SPECIFIC VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED:
1. Ventilation System Deficiency:
   - Current system provides only 2 air changes per hour
   - OSHA standard requires minimum 6 air changes per hour for chemical storage
   - Exhaust fans are not functioning properly (Fan #3 completely inoperative)

2. Chemical Storage Issues:
   - Incompatible chemicals stored in proximity (acids near bases)
   - Several containers lack proper labelling
   - Emergency eyewash station blocked by storage boxes
   - Spill containment materials insufficient for volume stored

3. Employee Exposure Risks:
   - Employees report headaches and respiratory irritation
   - No personal protective equipment provided for storage area access
   - Air quality monitoring has not been conducted in over 18 months

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE CONCERNS:
This situation violates:
- HSE COSHH Regulations 2002
- HSE Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992
- HSE Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Repair/replace ventilation system within 30 days
2. Relocate incompatible chemicals immediately
3. Provide proper PPE for all employees accessing the area
4. Conduct air quality assessment
5. Clear emergency equipment access paths
6. Update chemical inventory and labeling

POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES:
Failure to address these issues could result in:
- Employee illness or injury
- HSE enforcement notices and fines up to £20,000 per violation
- Workers' compensation claims
- Potential criminal liability for wilful violations
- Business interruption due to regulatory shutdown

COST ESTIMATE:
Estimated cost to remediate: £35,000 - £50,000
- Ventilation system repair: £27,000 - £38,000
- Chemical reorganisation and storage: £4,000 - £6,000
- PPE and safety equipment: £2,500 - £4,000
- Air quality testing: £1,500 - £2,000

RECOMMENDATION:
I strongly recommend immediate action to address these violations. The risk to employee health and safety, combined with potential regulatory penalties, far outweighs the cost of remediation.

I am available to discuss this report and coordinate remediation efforts with management and facilities personnel.
