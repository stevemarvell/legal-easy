UK CONTRACT LAW PRECEDENTS AND PRINCIPLES

1. FORMATION OF CONTRACTS
Essential Elements:
- Offer: Clear, definite proposal
- Acceptance: Unqualified agreement to terms
- Consideration: Exchange of value or promise
- Intention to create legal relations
- Certainty of terms

Key Case: Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co [1893] 1 QB 256 - Established principles of unilateral contracts and consideration.

2. OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE
Offer must be distinguished from invitation to treat. Acceptance must be communicated and match the terms of the offer.

Key Cases:
- Fisher v. Bell [1961] 1 QB 394 - Goods in shop window are invitation to treat, not offer
- Entores Ltd v. Miles Far East Corporation [1955] 2 QB 327 - Postal rule does not apply to instantaneous communications

3. CONSIDERATION
"Consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate." Past consideration is generally not valid consideration.

Key Cases:
- Chappell & Co Ltd v. Nestl√© Co Ltd [1960] AC 87 - Chocolate bar wrappers constituted valid consideration
- Williams v. Roffey Bros [1991] 1 QB 1 - Practical benefit can constitute consideration

4. BREACH OF CONTRACT REMEDIES
Expectation Damages: Put claimant in position they would have been in if contract performed
Reliance Damages: Reimburse expenses incurred in reliance on contract
Restitution: Prevent unjust enrichment

Key Case: Hadley v. Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341 - Established remoteness test for consequential damages (still good law).

5. FRUSTRATION OF CONTRACT
Performance excused when supervening event makes performance impossible, illegal, or radically different.

Key Cases:
- Taylor v. Caldwell (1863) 3 B&S 826 - Contract frustrated when music hall burned down
- Davis Contractors Ltd v. Fareham UDC [1956] AC 696 - Established modern frustration doctrine

6. UNFAIR CONTRACT TERMS
Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and Consumer Rights Act 2015 regulate exclusion clauses and unfair terms.

Key Cases:
- Photo Production Ltd v. Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] AC 827 - Fundamental breach doctrine rejected
- Director General of Fair Trading v. First National Bank [2001] UKHL 52 - Test for unfair terms in consumer contracts

7. THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 allows third parties to enforce contracts in certain circumstances.

Key Case: Beswick v. Beswick [1968] AC 58 - Established privity doctrine and its limitations (pre-1999 Act).

8. MISREPRESENTATION
False statements of fact that induce contract formation may give rise to remedies.

Key Cases:
- Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v. Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465 - Established negligent misrepresentation
- Royscot Trust Ltd v. Rogerson [1991] 2 QB 297 - Damages under s.2(1) Misrepresentation Act 1967

9. DURESS AND UNDUE INFLUENCE
Contracts may be voidable if entered into under duress or undue influence.

Key Cases:
- Universe Tankships Inc v. International Transport Workers Federation [1983] 1 AC 366 - Economic duress
- Royal Bank of Scotland v. Etridge (No 2) [2001] UKHL 44 - Undue influence in surety cases

10. PENALTY CLAUSES
Contractual provisions for breach are unenforceable if they constitute penalties rather than genuine pre-estimates of loss.

Key Case: Makdessi v. Cavendish Square Holdings [2015] UKSC 67 - Modern approach to penalty clauses, focusing on whether clause is extravagant or unconscionable.
