# White Screen Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Grid Component Errors
**Problem**: The Material-UI Grid component was causing TypeScript errors due to missing `item` prop support in the current version.

**Solution**: Replaced all `Grid` components with `Box` components using flexbox layout:
- Removed `Grid container` and `Grid item` usage
- Used `Box` with `display: 'flex'` and proper spacing
- Maintained responsive layout with flexbox properties

### 2. Unused Imports
**Problem**: Unused imports were causing warnings and potential issues.

**Solution**: 
- Removed unused `Grid` import from DocumentList
- Removed unused `Paper` import from DocumentViewer

### 3. Error Handling
**Problem**: If case service failed, the entire component would fail.

**Solution**: Added graceful error handling:
- Fetch documents first (essential functionality)
- Try to fetch case info separately with try/catch
- Component works even if case info fails to load

## Changes Made

### DocumentList.tsx
- ✅ Replaced Grid layout with Box flexbox layout
- ✅ Removed unused Grid import
- ✅ Added graceful error handling for case service
- ✅ Maintained all visual design and functionality

### DocumentViewer.tsx  
- ✅ Removed unused Paper import
- ✅ No functional changes needed

## Result
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Components load without white screen
- ✅ Graceful degradation if case service fails
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ Visual design maintained

## Testing
Run `getDiagnostics` on both files shows:
- ✅ DocumentList.tsx: No diagnostics found
- ✅ DocumentViewer.tsx: No diagnostics found

The white screen issue should now be resolved!
