# How It Works

## System Architecture Overview

The Shift AI Legal Platform operates as a modern, cloud-native application with AI capabilities integrated throughout the user journey.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Document Ingestion & Processing
```
Document Upload → AI Analysis → Information Extraction → Storage & Indexing
```

**Technologies Used:**
- **[PLANNED]** Claude AI for document understanding and analysis
- **Vector Databases** for semantic document storage
- **OCR & Text Processing** for document digitization

**Process:**
1. Documents uploaded through web interface or API
2. **[PLANNED]** Claude AI will analyze content for legal concepts, entities, and structure
3. Key information extracted (dates, parties, clauses, legal issues)
4. Document vectorized and stored for semantic search
5. Confidence scores assigned to extracted information

### 2. Case Management Workflow
```
Case Creation → Document Association → AI Analysis → Playbook Application → Recommendations
```

**Technologies Used:**
- **PostgreSQL** for structured case data
- **CrewAI** for multi-agent case analysis
- **Custom ML Models** for case outcome prediction

**Process:**
1. Cases created manually or through automated intake
2. Documents and evidence associated with cases
3. AI agents analyze case strength and applicable legal frameworks
4. Legal playbooks applied to generate recommendations
5. Real-time updates and notifications to stakeholders

### 3. Legal Research Engine
```
Query Input → Semantic Search → Precedent Matching → Result Ranking → Citation Analysis
```

**Technologies Used:**
- **Vector Databases** for semantic similarity search
- **[PLANNED]** Claude AI for query understanding and result analysis
- **Legal Citation APIs** for validation and linking

**Process:**
1. Natural language research queries processed
2. Semantic search across legal document corpus
3. Relevant precedents and statutes identified
4. Results ranked by relevance and authority
5. Citations validated and cross-referenced

### 4. Playbook Decision Engine
```
Case Analysis → Rule Matching → Confidence Assessment → Recommendation Generation
```

**Technologies Used:**
- **Rule Engine** for legal logic processing
- **ML Models** for case strength assessment
- **CrewAI** for multi-perspective analysis

**Process:**
1. Case facts analyzed against playbook rules
2. Applicable legal frameworks identified
3. Case strength and risks assessed
4. Strategic recommendations generated
5. Escalation paths and next steps provided
